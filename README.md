# NoteNinja

NoteNinja is the first game I have built. It was made using Python and Pyglet. Players must match randomly generated notes (letters) with their keyboard, to earn points while enjoying an animated goose-themed background and immersive music. This project was made for the AstonHack9 hackathon in Aston University, Birmingham. The music and animations were made by me, although the art (background, goose, obstacles) was picked from pinterest.

## How It Works
1. **Start Screen**: The game begins with a start screen where you can click the "Start" button to begin.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - A random note (letter) appears above the animated obstacle.
   - Press the correct key to match the note and score points.
   - The game dynamically updates the score and generates new notes.
3. **Quit Button**: Click the quit button to end the game and reset the score.

## Lessons Learned
This project was built under unique circumstances. Due to unforeseen challenges during the hackathon, I had to start from scratch at midnight and complete the project solo within six hours. It taught me:
- **Resilience**: Staying focused and productive under pressure.
- **Quick Problem-Solving**: Adapting to challenges and implementing solutions in real-time.
- **Efficient Development**: Prioritizing features and functionality to meet a strict deadline.

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels to enhance gameplay.
- Incorporate more animations and obstacles.
- Add multiple user sign in to track their separate high scores
- Add a leaderboard for tracking high scores.
- Use piano keyboard as input instead of laptop keyboard (Will prove to be a good practice session to help beginners find keys on the piano based on their note names.)
